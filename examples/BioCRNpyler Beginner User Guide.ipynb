    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "BioCRNpyler is a software tool designed to rapidly compile large biological chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from simple user specifications (written in python). It has built in support of a number of models for transcription, translation, and gene expression regulation using components common in _E. coli_ synthetic biology. This tutorial explains the inner workings of BioCRNpyler and shows how to create custom mixtures, components, and mechanisms. Specifically, we will go through making a custom gene expression model:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    ">$G \\to G + P \\rightleftharpoons G:P \\to G + P + X$\n",
    "\n",
    "here $G$ is a gene and $P$ is a polymerase and $X$ is the protein expressed by $G$. No translational machinery is included in this model, making it one of the simplest possible for expression. Note that we are ignoring translation for simplicitiy, not becuase it isn't important.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the user level, BioCRNplyer provides a CRNLab class that can be used to create a reaction mixture system with - \n",
    "* extract, a buffer, and other desired \"extracts\"\n",
    "* DNA components\n",
    "* specify volume of each extract and concentrations of DNA components\n",
    "\n",
    "After adding all components, a combined model can be obtained as an SBML model object that can be simulated using your simulator of choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features: \n",
    "* Write your own custom \"extract\" in `extracts.py` and simply use them with `txtl.mixture` in the `extract` argument.\n",
    "* Specify your own parameter file in the `muxture_parameters` argument (look at `Perfect Param File Example.tsv` for a specimen) or just use default files available with bioCRNpyler.\n",
    "* Specify the volume of a extract being added in `txtl.mixture` using mixture_volume keyword argument or just specify the final_volume for the model.\n",
    "* Control warning messages with arguments for `parameter_warning` and `warning` for general warnings (as a boolean).\n",
